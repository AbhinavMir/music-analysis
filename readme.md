## Run instructions
(This project has shitty codebase, I didn't even bother hiding my ParallelDots API key, use it, but if it runs out, replace it with yours)
* This is to be run like a usual PHP website
* Make sure you have Python3, debug as usual
* Import DB.SQL into your localhost after creating a database called 'MUSICREC'
* Make sure you're online because we need CDNs referenced
* Start your apache/appserv server
* Go to your localhost:[port]/[filename]
